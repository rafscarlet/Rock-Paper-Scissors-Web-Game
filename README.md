# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Web-Game
This is a game I made from scratch with Node.js, Express.js, EJS and CSS.

This project requires node.js to run! After you download node, you open your terminal and go to the directory of the project. 

- You will need to run `npm i` to install all the dependencies and packages. In case some of these are outdated you will be notified and you can update them simply by running  `npm audit fix`.
- After that you are ready to run the project with the command `node index.js`

The Express server will be available at your localhost port 3000 (localhost:3000)
