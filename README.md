# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Web-Game
This is a game I made from scratch with Node.js, Express.js, EJS and CSS.

## How to run 
This project requires node.js to run! After you download node, you open your terminal and go to the directory of the project. 

- You will need to run `npm i` to install all the dependencies and packages. In case some of these are outdated you will be notified and you can update them simply by running  `npm audit fix`.
- After that you are ready to run the project with the command `node index.js`

The Express server will be available at your localhost port 3000 (localhost:3000)

## Possible Improvements
- [ ] Add animations for the buttons and results
- [ ] Maybe show the result as a pop up
- [ ] Add a 3-2-1 timer
- [ ] Make game mode where it ends at e.g. 10 rounds and shows the winner.
- [ ] Make it responsive to screen sizes.
